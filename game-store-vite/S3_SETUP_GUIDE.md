# S3 Configuration Setup Guide

## Issue Description
If you're seeing this error: **"InvalidAccessKeyId - The Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records"**, it means your backend S3 configuration needs to be set up properly.

## Required S3 Configuration

Your backend needs to be configured with valid S3 credentials to generate presigned URLs for file uploads. Here's what needs to be configured:

### 1. AWS S3 Credentials
Your backend should have these environment variables or configuration:

```bash
# AWS S3 Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_actual_access_key_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_actual_secret_key_here
AWS_REGION=your_s3_region (e.g., us-east-1)
S3_BUCKET_NAME=game-key-store

# Optional: For S3-compatible services (like Tebi.io)
S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.tebi.io  # Only if using non-AWS S3
```

### 2. S3 Bucket Setup
- Create an S3 bucket (or use S3-compatible service like Tebi.io)
- Set up proper CORS configuration for browser uploads
- Ensure the bucket has public read access for uploaded files

### 3. Backend API Endpoints
Your backend needs these endpoints (which seem to already exist):
- `POST /api/s3/presigned-upload-url` - Generate presigned upload URLs
- `DELETE /api/s3/delete-file` - Delete files from S3

## Quick Test
To test if S3 is configured correctly, check your backend logs when making an upload request. You should see successful presigned URL generation without authentication errors.

## Alternative Solutions

### For Development/Testing:
1. **Mock the upload functionality** - temporarily disable uploads and use local file storage
2. **Use local S3-compatible service** - like MinIO for development
3. **Use a free S3 service** - like Tebi.io with their free tier

### For Production:
1. **AWS S3** - The standard solution with reliable infrastructure
2. **Tebi.io** - S3-compatible service with competitive pricing
3. **Digital Ocean Spaces** - S3-compatible with simple pricing

## Current Configuration Detection
Based on your error logs, your app is currently configured to use:
- **Service**: Tebi.io (s3.tebi.io)
- **Bucket**: game-key-store
- **Current Access Key**: g4udXzG2YwtWS8bm (‚ùå Invalid)

## Steps to Fix:
1. Get valid S3 credentials from your chosen provider
2. Update your backend configuration with the correct credentials
3. Restart your backend server
4. Test file uploads from the frontend
